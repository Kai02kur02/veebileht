                THE INTERNET ISN'T run by techies, the Beygency, or the FCC. It's ruled by the animals that mesmerize us with their cute antics in GIFs, photos, and videos. But the animals of the web aren't just busy falling down and not being able to get up, or winning our hearts with a sneeze. They're also incredibly importantâ€”whether as research subjects or harbingers of climate change. Here's a list of some of our favorite animal scientists, writers, and photo feeds that you should follow for a daily serving of cute, with a side of knowledge.
                The ZooBorns Instagram feed, which features photos of baby animals from zoos around the world, is mostly about animals at their tiniest and most adorable. (Fennec fox kits! Sloths! Pangolins!) So squeee away, but don't forget that each time you get all mushy about an Emperor chick, you also, in some small way, cast a vote for preserving biodiversity and wilderness everywhere. It's a penguin win-win.</p>
